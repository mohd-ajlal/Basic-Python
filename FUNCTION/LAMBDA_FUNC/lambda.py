# Python Lambda Functions are anonymous function means that the function is without a name.
# As we already know that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python.
# Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.
# It is a small and restricted function having no more than one line. 
# Just like a normal function, a Lambda function can have multiple arguments with one expression.
# The expression is evaluated and returned.
# Syntax: lambda arguments: expression
# Example: lambda x: x + 10
# The above function takes one argument and adds 10 to it.
# Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like filter(), map() etc.
